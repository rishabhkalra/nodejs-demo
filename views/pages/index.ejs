          <ul>
            <li>Leading industry support, NodeJS is highly mature and has a thousands of open source libraries.</li>
            <li>Uses modules to add additional functionality such as I/O, networking tools (DNS, HTTP, TLS, etc), cryptographic algorithms and many other core functionality.</li>
            <li>Ability to create highly scalable web servers and networking tools.</li>
            <li>Ability to bring event driven programming to web servers.</li>

          <h3 class="text-center"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> Weaknesses</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Node.JS is a single threaded runtime engine, as a result it does not support multi-threading applications.</li>
            <li>Node.JS does not allow for vertical scaling.</li>
            <li>Uses the JavaScript event loop, which processes request in a queue; not suited for heavy server-side processing.</li>
            <li>Can only use JavaScript.</li>
